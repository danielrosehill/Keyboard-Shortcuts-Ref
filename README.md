# Keyboard Shortcuts Refence

![alt text](sloth-at-keyboard.jpg)

This is a living collection of keyboard shortcuts from various services around the Internet. 

Keyboard shortcuts, as useful as they are for boosting productivity, often exist in a state of flux. They can change unexpectedly—perhaps at the whim of a UX designer who decides that today, `Ctrl+A` should really be `Ctrl+B`.

Unlike API documentation, which tends to be well-maintained and versioned, keyboard shortcut references often fall by the wayside. This is surprising, given how integral they are to efficient workflows, especially within web UIs.

Most of the shortcuts documented here are for web-based interfaces. I'm using Ubuntu Linux on the desktop, and unless otherwise noted, these shortcuts should work the same across other systems. If a shortcut behaves differently on another platform, I’ll try to include a note along with the date the difference was observed.

As with many of the things I open source, this collection is primarily a personal reference. But if it turns out to be helpful to someone else, all the better.
